# Leslies-Algo-Practice

This repo is meant to track my progress with algorithm's and also keep me honest with my consistency!

This will range from different study materials such as udemy courses, textbook reads and algos from anywhere I can find such as Leetcode.com - hello darkness my old friend.. 
The main goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills by focusing on specific algo topics, analyzing and elaborating on different approaches, consistently psudocoding, solving problems naively && then optimize and analyzing Time/Space Complexities.
