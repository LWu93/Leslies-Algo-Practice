/*
Graphs Traversal -
When we want to Visit/Update/Check each vertex in a graph. We may not necessarily need to hit each vertex but we can narrow that down based on checks we implement.
When we start our traversal, we need to clarify where to start. It may not matter but there may be optimizations and directed/undirected graphs to keep in mind.

Graph Traversal uses
- Peer to peer networking (mutual friends or friends of friends)
- Web crawlers. starting at a website and crawling it. then following all links on that website to the next.
- finding the "closest" vertex. Specifically for recommendations for restaurants, games, furniture, etc.
- Shortest path problems. GPS navigation for different scenarios, solving mazes, fastest/shortest path to winning a game or hitting a certain point.

Depth First Traversal - Traversing to a node and continuing to visit its unvisited neighbors until there are no more.
